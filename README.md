# 3d-hubs-assignment

Skills assessment assignment for 3d hubs

## Requirements

#### [Install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Development

#### Clone the repository

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/thefabulousdev/3d-hubs-assignment.git
```

#### Install dependencies
``` sh
npm install
```

#### Use npm scripts

* `npm run test` to execute tests
* `npm run build` to build an optimized version of the library in `/dist`
* `npm run serve:dev` to launch a browser sync server on the source files
* `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server with the optimized library files

### Remarks

 - As time ran shorter, and due to the complexity of a recursive composite architecture, tests were pulled aside
 in favor of a runnable demo
